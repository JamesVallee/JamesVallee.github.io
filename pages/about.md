    <div class="bio-section">
      <p>Hello, I’m <strong>James Vallée</strong>, a mechanical engineering student with hands-on experience in vehicle systems, composites, and structural design. I have worked in both academic and professional environments, from aerospace research at the NRC to industry internships at Bombardier Recreational Products, and I’m an active Formula SAE uOttawa member.</p>
      <p>My work spans the full engineering workflow:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Design and analysis of chassis, suspension, and aerodynamic components</li>
        <li>FEA and structural validation to optimize strength-to-weight ratios</li>
        <li>Composite manufacturing, wet layups, and prepreg/autoclave processes</li>
        <li>Vehicle instrumentation, testing, and data-driven model validation</li>
        <li>CAD modeling, parametric optimization, and design for manufacturability</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This portfolio highlights the projects, research, and practical experience I’ve gained across multiple engineering disciplines, with a focus on performance, innovation, and problem-solving in real-world applications.</p>
